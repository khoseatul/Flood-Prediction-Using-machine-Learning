# **Flood Prediction using Machine Learning**

This repository contains Python scripts and resources for predicting floods using machine learning algorithms. The project aims to leverage historical weather data, river levels, terrain information, and other relevant features to build predictive models for flood events.

## Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Scripts for collecting and preprocessing historical weather data, river level data, and other relevant datasets for flood prediction.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Python scripts for training machine learning models using prepared datasets and evaluating model performance.

- **Real-time Prediction**: Tools for making real-time flood predictions based on live weather data and other available inputs.

- **Visualization**: Visualization tools for displaying flood prediction results, including interactive maps, charts, and graphs.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/flood-prediction-machine-learning.git
